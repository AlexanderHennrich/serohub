## Scope

## What is seroprevalence?
In epidemiological terms __prevalence__ is the proportion of people in population who have a disease.

Consequently  __seroprevalence__ the proportion of people who were tested positive for a specific disease based on serology (blood serum). Seroprevalence studies help determine the infection dynamics in geographical regions or population subgroups.
